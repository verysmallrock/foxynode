# FoxyNode

A base project for a node.js-based application using CoffeeScript, Stylus, and Jade.  

# Getting Started

`npm install`

`gulp` (in a standalone console)

# Project Info

The goal of this project is to help avoid the hour+ setup time each time you want to create a new node project.  I am opinionated about what makes beautiful code, and I have chosen CoffeeScript and Stylus because of this (that's easily changed if you want to make fork me).

Pre-configured bits:

### Server
- express
- gulp & nodemon (for autoreloading after code changes)

### Client
- Autoreload
